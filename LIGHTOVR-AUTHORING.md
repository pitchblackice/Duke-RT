# LIGHTOVR Authoring Guide

`LIGHTOVR` is Duke-RT's text overlay database for authored ray-traced lighting behavior. This guide covers the file format, load/reload behavior, and the current in-game light edit workflows.

## LIGHTOVR Authoring and Usage

`LIGHTOVR` is the text overlay database for RT-authored lighting behavior. The parser scans all mounted root-level `LIGHTOVR` lumps, merges them in load order, and uses last-wins replacement for duplicate rule ids within the same scope.

General workflow:

- mount a loose overlay directory with `-file M:\Raze\overlay`
- place a file at `M:\Raze\overlay\LIGHTOVR`
- use `lightoverlay_reload` console command after edits
- inspect the parsed database with `lightoverlay_dump`
- inspect the resolved current-map view with `lightoverlay_dumpresolved [mapname]`
- inspect normalized round-trippable output with `lightoverlay_dumpnormalized`
- export the normalized database with `lightoverlay_export <path>`

Current top-level `LIGHTOVR` blocks:

- `defaults`
  Placeholder root block. It currently exists for future shared defaults, but no fields are consumed yet.
- `actorrule <id>`
  Global actor-bound analytic light rule. This is the main authored point-light path for sprite-driven actors such as fires, rockets, and similar cases.
- `muzzleflashrule <event_id>`
  Global event-driven muzzle-flash rule. This binds a weapon-fire event id to a transient analytic light definition.
- `map <mapname> { ... }`
  Map-local scope for persistent placed lights and overrides.

Current map-local blocks:

- `directional <id>`
  One authored directional fill/shadow light for a map.
- `light <id>`
  A placed analytic point light anchored to a Build/world position, sector, or wall.
- `actoroverride <id>`
  Map-local actor shadow override. This adjusts shadow receive/cast policy without creating a light by itself.
- `emissiveoverride <id>`
  Map-local override for emissive surfaces, used to tune intensity/reach scaling and bind an emitter to a sector-light signal.
- `surfacelight <id>`
  Map-local PT-only visible fixture plus associated analytic point light, usually authored by aiming at a surface in emissive light edit mode and pressing `o`.

Current parser fields by block:

- `actorrule`
  `actorclass`, `shadowreceive`, `shadowcast`, `fullbright`, `tile`, `type`, `color`, `intensity`, `radius`, `range`, `offset`, `direction`, `flicker`, `random`, `localspace`
- `muzzleflashrule`
  `color`, `intensity`, `intensityrandom`, `radius`, `radiusrandom`, `delayseconds`, `delayrandomseconds`, `durationseconds`, `durationrandomseconds`, `offset`
- `directional`
  `color`, `intensity`, `direction`, `angularsize`, `shadow`
- `light`
  `type`, `anchor`, `offset`, `direction`, `color`, `intensity`, `radius`, `range`, `flicker`
- `actoroverride`
  `actorclass`, `shadowreceive`, `shadowcast`
- `emissivematerialresponse`
  `tile`, `tilerange`, `texture`, `materialresponse`, `materialresponsemin`, `materialresponsemax`
- `emissiveoverride`
  `sector`, `wall`, `tile`, `intensityscale`, `reachscale`, `sectorresponse`, `signal sector`, `responseintensity`, `responsemin`, `responsemax`, `responseinputmin`, `responseinputmax`, `responseintensitymin`, `responseintensitymax`, `responsereachmin`, `responsereachmax`, `materialresponse`, `materialresponsemin`, `materialresponsemax`
- `surfacelight`
  `anchor surface`, `position`, `normal`, `size`, `rotation`, `offset`, `sector`, `wall`, `tile`, `fixture texture`, `fixturetexture`, `fixturematerialresponse`, `type`, `color`, `intensity`, `radius`, `sectorresponse`, `signal sector`, `responseintensity`, `responsemin`, `responsemax`, `responseinputmin`, `responseinputmax`, `materialresponsemin`, `materialresponsemax`

Current practical notes:

- duplicate `actorrule` and `muzzleflashrule` ids are global and last-wins
- duplicate `directional`, `light`, and `actoroverride` ids are last-wins within the same map
- actor and map analytic overlays are currently consumed as point lights on the PT path even if extra shape fields such as `range` or `direction` are authored
- `light` `anchor position` and `offset` values are authored in Build/world coordinates; the NRI renderer converts them to path-tracing render coordinates internally
- `surfacelight` `position` and `normal` are authored in path-tracing render coordinates because they are captured directly from the aimed PT surface probe
- `actorrule fullbright on` forces matching actor sprite and voxel surfaces onto the PT fullbright material path so they ignore scene lighting and render at full brightness
- `actorrule random <min> <max>` adds a per-render-frame random intensity offset to the base intensity and is an alternative to `flicker`
- `actoroverride` is applied after `actorrule`, so explicit per-map shadow overrides win
- `emissivematerialresponse` is global and is applied before map-local `emissiveoverride`, so a specific surface override can still opt out or change the clamp

## Muzzle Flash Rule Breakdown

`muzzleflashrule <event_id>` defines a transient analytic light that is triggered by a weapon-fire event. The event id is matched case-insensitively against the gameplay emitters wired into the renderer bridge.

- `color <r> <g> <b>`
  Base RGB light color.
- `intensity <value>`
  Base peak intensity before per-shot randomization.
- `intensityrandom <min> <max>`
  Multiplier range applied once per shot to the base intensity.
- `radius <value>`
  Base light radius before per-shot randomization.
- `radiusrandom <min> <max>`
  Multiplier range applied once per shot to the base radius.
- `delayseconds <seconds>`
  Base delay before the flash becomes visible.
- `delayrandomseconds <min> <max>`
  Extra randomized delay range, resolved once per shot.
- `durationseconds <seconds>`
  Base visible lifetime of the flash after activation.
- `durationrandomseconds <min> <max>`
  Extra randomized lifetime range, resolved once per shot. A single authored value in normalized output becomes a symmetric signed range.
- `offset <x> <y> <z>`
  Local event-space offset from the emitted weapon origin.

Current runtime behavior:

- each shot resolves one randomized peak intensity and one randomized radius
- each shot also resolves randomized delay and duration in real seconds
- the light stays off until the resolved delay expires
- when it activates, it starts at the resolved peak intensity
- it then fades to zero over the resolved duration using an expo-out easing curve
- the transient slot topology stays stable so repeated shots do not churn PT light-history topology

Useful muzzle-flash diagnostics:

- `lightoverlay_dumpresolved [mapname]`
  Confirms that the `muzzleflashrule` was parsed and resolved.
- `nri_ptmuzzleflash_test <rule_id>`
  Queues a synthetic muzzle-flash event against a resolved rule id.
- `nri_ptstatus`
  Prints analytic-light counts, including muzzle-slot counts, once PT is active in-level.


## Actor Light Edit Mode

The actor light editor is a runtime helper for authoring global `actorrule` placeholders against live actors. It writes only to a writable loose mounted `LIGHTOVR`; archive-backed sources such as `.pk3`, `.zip`, `.wad`, `.grp`, and similar mounted bundles remain readable but are intentionally not edit targets. Actor and map light edit modes always start disabled on launch and must be enabled at runtime.

Launch with a loose overlay mount so the editor has a file it can rewrite:

```powershell
build\terminal-ninja\raze.exe -nosound -file M:\Raze\overlay +set vid_preferbackend 4 +set nri_api d3d12 +map e1l1
```

Recommended setup:

- create or mount a loose overlay directory, for example `M:\Raze\overlay`
- place the writable file at `M:\Raze\overlay\LIGHTOVR`
- start a live map with the RT backend active
- run `nri_ptactorlighteditwritable` to confirm which mounted `LIGHTOVR` path will be used for writeback
- run `nri_ptactorlighteditmode 1` to enable edit mode

While edit mode is enabled:

- aiming at an actor shows the actor class through the native pickup-style notify path
- `p` prints the current target data; actor hits print class/index/position/sector/state details, and surface hits route through the RT surface-probe status hook
- `o` on an actor creates a placeholder global `actorrule`, writes the normalized database back to the mounted loose `LIGHTOVR`, and reloads overlays immediately
- `l` reloads `LIGHTOVR` without editing the file, useful after changing the file externally
- `nri_ptactorlightedittarget` performs a one-shot target sample and prints the current actor/surface/miss classification

The placeholder rule created by `o` uses the actor class as its id base and starts as a point light with warm color, `intensity 8.0`, `radius 96.0`, and zero offset. Edit the generated rule in the mounted `LIGHTOVR`, then press `l` or run `lightoverlay_reload` to apply the tuned values.

Disable edit mode with:

```text
nri_ptactorlighteditmode 0
```

## Map Light Edit Mode

The map light editor is a runtime helper for placing map-scoped `light` rules at explicit world positions. It uses the same writable loose-mounted `LIGHTOVR` writeback rules as actor light edit mode.

Recommended setup is the same as actor light editing, then run:

```text
nri_ptmaplighteditmode 1
```

While map light edit mode is enabled:

- a white point-light preview floats in front of the local camera
- `[` moves the preview closer to the camera, clamped at distance `0`
- `]` moves the preview farther from the camera
- `p` writes a map-local `light` rule at the preview position, with `type point`, `anchor position`, white color, `intensity 1.0`, `radius 200.0`, and no flicker field, then reloads `LIGHTOVR`
- `o` sets the map's active `directional` rule to the player camera look direction, preserving existing directional color/intensity/shadow/angular-size fields when one already exists
- `l` reloads `LIGHTOVR` without editing the file

Disable edit mode with:

```text
nri_ptmaplighteditmode 0
```

## Emissive Light Override Edit Mode

The emissive light editor writes map-local `emissiveoverride` rules for surfaces that are already active PT emitters. It uses the same writable loose-mounted `LIGHTOVR` writeback rules as the actor and map light editors. The mode is intentionally non-persistent and always starts disabled on launch.

Enable it at runtime with:

```text
nri_ptemissivelighteditmode 1
```

While emissive light edit mode is enabled:

- `p` creates or updates a map-local `emissiveoverride` for the aimed active emitter
- `o` creates a map-local `surfacelight` for the aimed wall, ceiling, or floor, even if the aimed surface is not already emissive
- the generated rule targets the surface with the current sector, wall, and renderer texture id when available
- new rules start with `intensityscale 1.0`, `reachscale 1.0`, `sectorresponse on`, and `signal sector <aimed sector>`
- new rules copy the current `nri_ptsectoremissionintensity`, `nri_ptsectoremissionmin`, and `nri_ptsectoremissionmax` values into `responseintensity`, `responsemin`, and `responsemax`
- new `surfacelight` rules default to `size 32.0 32.0`, `offset 0.5`, white `color 1.0 1.0 1.0`, `intensity 4.0`, and `radius 512.0`
- `l` reloads `LIGHTOVR` without editing the file
- nearby sector-emission response changes produce short notify messages naming the affected sector and whether the response is boosted, dimmed, or neutral
- nearby sector surface-lighting changes also produce notify messages, even when no active emitter is currently bound to that sector
- `nri_ptemissivelighteditnotifyrange` controls the player-relative range for those sector-change notify messages; the default is `2048.0`

Edit the generated `signal sector` when an emitter needs to follow a different sector's switch state, then press `l` to reload.

`surfacelight` rules use the same sector-response fields as `emissiveoverride`, but they create their own PT-only fixture quad and an associated analytic point light. The visible fixture texture defaults to `nri_ptsurfacelighttexture`. The initial dimensions, offset, color, intensity, radius, and sector-response default come from `nri_ptsurfacelightwidth`, `nri_ptsurfacelightheight`, `nri_ptsurfacelightoffset`, `nri_ptsurfacelightred`, `nri_ptsurfacelightgreen`, `nri_ptsurfacelightblue`, `nri_ptsurfacelightintensity`, `nri_ptsurfacelightradius`, and `nri_ptsurfacelightsectorresponse`. The width, height, offset, and color placement cvars are runtime-only editor defaults, so stale config values do not override the built-in 32x32 white fixture default.

Placed `surfacelight` rules can also be edited in-place while `nri_ptemissivelighteditmode 1` is active. Aim at a placed `surfacelight` when possible; if the crosshair probe misses the generated fixture surface, the editor falls back to the most recently placed or successfully edited `surfacelight` on the current map.

Surface-light edit hotkeys:

- mouse wheel up/down rotates the fixture around its surface normal in 15 degree steps and writes `rotation`
- left/right arrow decreases/increases `size` X in 4 unit steps
- up/down arrow increases/decreases `size` Y in 4 unit steps
- `,` and `.` decrease/increase `intensity` in 0.5 steps
- `;` and `'` decrease/increase `radius` in 32 unit steps
- `[` and `]` cycle the fixture texture

The surface-light texture cycle is:

```text
#00124, #00701, #00702, #00703, #00707, #00708, #01206, #00705, #00706,
#00704, #00126, #00120, #00121, #00122, #00123, #00127, #00128
```

Each hotkey edit writes the normalized `LIGHTOVR` file, prints the edited rule's current size/rotation/texture/intensity/radius through the native notify path, and reloads overlays immediately.

For switch sectors whose "on" and "off" values are both below the global sector-emission neutral point, add `responseinputmin` and `responseinputmax`. When both fields are present, the raw sector signal maps directly from `responseinputmin` -> `responsemin` to `responseinputmax` -> `responsemax`, instead of using the global neutral response curve. The edit-mode sector-change message prints this authoring value as `signal=...`.

Visible emissive material response is opt-in. For broad texture-based cases, add a global `emissivematerialresponse` rule with any mix of `texture`, `tile`, and `tilerange` selectors. `texture` matches the surface texture name case-insensitively and ignores a filename extension, so `#00707.PNG` can match a probed texture name like `#00707`; `tile` and `tilerange` match renderer texture ids like the existing `emissiveoverride tile` field. `materialresponsemin` and `materialresponsemax` clamp only the material's visible/direct/indirect emission, so a fixture can cast boosted light through `responsemax` while its visible panel stays within an off-to-normal range such as `0.0` to `1.0`; if either clamp is omitted, the corresponding `nri_ptsectoremissionmaterialmin` or `nri_ptsectoremissionmaterialmax` cvar supplies the fallback. Map-local `emissiveoverride` entries are applied after the global texture rule; use `materialresponse off` or per-rule `materialresponsemin`/`materialresponsemax` there when one surface needs different behavior.

Disable edit mode with:

```text
nri_ptemissivelighteditmode 0
```
